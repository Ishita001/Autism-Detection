# Medical Care - Autism Specturm Disorder

Problem ---  How might we test the state of autism in a child/adult & tackle it through a therapy.

Autism----

Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. Autism affects every 1 in every 40 children in the world. Autism is a disease which cannot be cured but if identified early, effective measures can be taken to reduce the adverse effects of it. This is often difficult to analyze since they lack communication skills. We, therefore, create a calm environment to trigger joint attention that is helping them share their interests and regulate them and their behavior while the parent can access information to understand his/her child better. Our web application has virtual reality scenarios of real life situations so as to help children and adults overcome their fear for that situation when it comes to real life.

solution--- An AI-VR based application to help people with autism improve communication, social and other basic abilities required to live in a society.

We aim to help these children by training their brains and letting them control their world and feel less anxious and more confident and also help their parents understand and monitor them. We understand and identify a childâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. This is often difficult to analyze since they lack communication skills.

What our project does is, it gives a set of YES/NO questions that are to be answered by either the parent of the child or the adult suffering from Autism and then we match those answers with the dataset which then return the level of autism that the child/dult is suffering from.Depending on this level we can either increase or decrease the extremecy of our VR therapy and give personal care if required. Now when the child is going through the VR session even the parent can view what their child/ adult is doing inside the virtual environment using the parent app from anywhere and advice their ward providing extra support to the autistic candidate.

Thses things sound good when we hear, but do they actually work? Hence we researched about whether VR can actually bring change in how they behave in their real-live after VR therapies and hence we bulit our models on top of them, their references can be found at the links below:

1) Does the entry clearly establish a challenge faced by community?
   Now Every year only in india there are nearly 12000 new autism cases recorded and many more might be present which are not counted.
   On average in USA around $60000(42 lakhs INR)  and in India 4Lakhs is spent on autism treatment but these cant make the child ready      enough to face reallife situations which our VR application does.
   
2) How major is the problem and how practical is the solution?
   With such a huge number of cases, life of each and every one of them while growing is actuall tough. VR is becoming a household name 
   these days and may be in the next 2-3 years every household might have a VR headset and so it is quite feasible.
   
3) Will the solution improve people's lives?
    It suely will improve people's life. Cause we are providing something that many autistic people would love to use and there is 
    nothing of this sort in market.
    
4) Is there a future plan of extension?
  Yes, we plan to make this hackathon project in a complete product and take it to the real world. Cause there is a lot of scope for 
  applications like this. We can talk to psychiatrist's and other special education centres and provide them with this solution to help 
  children annd adults out there to overcome their fears.
  
5) Does the soulution address the challenge put forth by the team?
   We believe it does, because our approcah is to determine the level of autism which our AI model is doing and then helping people 
   overcome their fesr which our VR application does.
   
6) Technologies?
   We used a kaggle autsim dataset which is built by few of the best autistic doctors in the world and then we used unity3d, google vr 
   sdk,mirror networking (for parent view), Telelpathy Lib and photoshop.

   Scalability---
   
a) 1 in 500 or 0.20% or more than 2,160,000 people in India. Incidence Rate: Approx. 1 in 90,666 or 11,914 people in India. Incidence extrapolations for India for Autism: 11,914 per year, 250 per month, 57 per week, 8 per day, 1.4 per hour.

b)In 2018 the CDC reported that 1 in 40 children have been identified with ASD, this number is increasing at a rate of 15% every year.

c)The Global autistic spectrum disorder therapeutics market size was valued at  US $ 3293.0 Million in 2018 and is projected to reach US $ 4612.1. Million by 2026.
